single Source of truth:
    -the globle state of your application is store in an object tree within a single store

State is read only :

    the only way to change the state is to emit an action abject describing what happend


Change are made with pure functions
    -to specify how the state tree is transfored by actions you write pure deducrs 


  event habdler(Dispath)   ---> Store<state>
            ^                     
            |                     |
            -----<    UI    <-----



#reduser 

    -it is an pure functions that recives the previou state and action from
    and returen a new state
        - we have to create and  return a completely new stat withou changig the 
        previous state

    -pure function
        - returen the same output when given the same input
        - must not contain side effects


redux keeps the app state in one place 
you must update the app state only in the presribed way


means- a rule, guide, or course of action that has been set down, or a way that conforms to a set usage, procedure, or discipline

State :
