single Source of truth:
    -the globle state of your application is store in an object tree within a single store

State is read only :

    the only way to change the state is to emit an action abject describing what happend


Change are made with pure functions
    -to specify how the state tree is transfored by actions you write pure deducrs 


  event habdler(Dispath)   ---> Store<state>
            ^                     
            |                     |
            -----<    UI    <-----



#reduser 

    -it is an pure functions that recives the previou state and action from
    and returen a new state
        - we have to create and  return a completely new stat withou changig the 
        previous state

    -pure function
        - returen the same output when given the same input
        - must not contain side effects


redux keeps the app state in one place 
you must update the app state only in the presribed way


means- a rule, guide, or course of action that has been set down, or a way that conforms to a set usage, procedure, or discipline



core packges : --
                redux 
                flutter_redux
                redux_thunk


                redux:
                    -a core library that allow you to mange and update the centrlized
                    app state using event called actions
                
                flutter_redux: : 
                    - a set of utility that makes it easy to use the redyx store to byukd flutter widgets

                redux_thunk: 
                    - a packges that makes it easy for your reduX app to handle async opreations that are almost always included in mider apps




State :
    - the state can be any value 
        -like prmitive type :string ,int 
        - or we defined class

    Use class-type state whenever it possible


Action:
    action due to that it will resion state will we change
    type +Payload
    type:it is type of action to to describing the action are which type 
    paylaod :it is the adition data required to peform the action 



Reduser 

    -it is pure function that takes two arguments
    and computes a new state

    this funtin take the tow arguments that is 
        1 current state 
        2 action 

           depedend on 
             that 
              it


            new state
            is defined
            
             
    


Store 
    - it hold the app stat tree
    it is the class having two requird arguments: 
        1 reduser  //this is positinal 
        2 intial state  //this named 

    it it has on optinal importante argument aslo called as
        3 middleware  //this is also named but it is optional
